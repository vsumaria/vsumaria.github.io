I am a Graduate Ph.D. Student in the Department of Chemical Engineering at University of California Los Angeles working with [Dr. Philippe Sautet](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/sautet-group/member/).  My reseach is in the field of computational material science and it's application in surface science, electrochemical and enenrgy storage systems, catalysis and amorphous metallic systems. My reserch at UCLA utilizes Density Functional Theory with Machine Learning to understand metal/gas interfaces and surface reconstructions and identify new materials for chemical transformations. I received my M.S. in Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University where by thesis project was [Dr. Venkat Viswanathan](https://www.cmu.edu/me/venkatgroup/index.html) and I graduated with a B.Tech. in Chemical Engineering from University of Petroleum and Energy studies, Dehradun, India winnign the silver medal (class topper). 

Research
------------------
My Ph.D. research, funded primarily [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1800601&HistoricalAwards=false), is a collaborative work with Dr. Sautet (UCLA) and Dr. Tao (previously at Kansas University). The aim of the work is understanding adsorbate induced reconstruction. To be able to effeciently perform simulation on these complex systems involing surfaces with steps, kinks and different number of adsorbates and reaction conditions, we uilize High Dimentional Neural Network Potentials (HDDNP) and fast exploration algoriths (Basin hopping, genetic algorithm etc.).  

As a Computational Chemistry Intern at [Phaseshift Technologies](https://www.thephaseshift.com/), I worked on generating database for Bulk Metallic glass (BMG) alloy properties to train machine learning models for mechanical property prediction. I also developed framework for creating interatomic potentials for BMG with different compositions for rapid screening. The developed potentials were used successfully to predict and validate glass transition temperatures.
